# What/Who Goes Here?!

If you are a 3D printer (I like bad grammar), this is the place to be.

## Chassis

Alex (probably) finally added the 3D models. I don't really know why they went with the storefront route as the files are supposedly `GPLv3`, and the coupon code for the case files is on the store page(s). I'm uploading them here so they can be iterated upon easier.

## Shoulder Strap

This is a mount system for a custom shoulder strap. You will need to cut and bond your own strap into it, but I will not be one to put this in my pocket. I will get around to providing the `step` files, but for now here are some `stl`s.
